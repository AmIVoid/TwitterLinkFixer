# TwitterLinkFixer
A Discord bot to replace twitter.com and x.com links in discord with fxtwitter.com and fixupx.com so they embed in messages.

The bot will delete the original message and replace the link with the correct link to embed. If text is in the message it will also keep it in the new message.

Invite the bot [here.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1179216622339248138&scope=bot&permissions=8192)
